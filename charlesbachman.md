Bachman spent his entire career as a practicing software engineer or manager in industry 
rather than in academia. In 1950 he started working at Dow Chemical in Midland, Michigan. 
In 1957 he became Dow's first data processing manager. He worked with the IBM user group SHARE 
on developing a new version of report generator software, which became known as 9PAC. However, 
the planned IBM 709 order was cancelled before it arrived. In 1960 he joined General Electric, 
where by 1963 he developed the Integrated Data Store (IDS), one of the first database management 
systems using what came to be known as the navigational database model, in the Manufacturing 
Information And Control System (MIACS) product. Working for customer Weyerhaeuser Lumber, 
he developed the first multiprogramming network access to the IDS database, an early online 
transaction processing system called WEYCOS in 1965. Later at GE he developed the "dataBasic"
 product that offered database support to Basic language timesharing users. In 1970, GE sold its 
 computer business to Honeywell Information Systems, so he and his family moved from Phoenix, 
 Arizona to Lexington, Massachusetts. In 1981, he joined a smaller firm, Cullinane Information 
 Systems (later Cullinet), which offered a version of IDS that was called IDMS and supported IBM 
 mainframes.
