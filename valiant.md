Valiant si è laureato in matematica al King's College di Cambridge nel 1970, si è specializzato nel 1971 in informatica presso l'Imperial College of Science di Londra e ha conseguito il dottorato di ricerca nel 1973 all'Università di Warwick.
Les Valiant has had an extraordinarily productive career in theoretical computer science producing results of great beauty and originality. His research has opened new frontiers and has resulted in a transformation of many areas. His work includes the study of both natural and artificial phenomena. The natural studies encompass the algorithms used by computing objects such as the human brain while the artificial include computers and their capabilities. In the case of computers the limitations of these devices are only beginning to be understood while for natural objects, such as the human brain, the questions of how they operate remain to be answered.
