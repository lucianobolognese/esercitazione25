# ARTHUR JOHN ROBIN GORELL ("ROBIN") MILNER 

For three distinct and complete achievements:

LCF, the mechanization of Scott's Logic of Computable Functions, probably the first theoretically based yet practical tool for machine assisted proof construction;
ML, the first language to include polymorphic type inference together with a type-safe exception-handling mechanism;
CCS, a general theory of concurrency.
In addition, he formulated and strongly advanced full abstraction, the study of the relationship between operational and denotational semantics.
